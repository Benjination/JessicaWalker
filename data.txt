About
I donâ€™t just recruit. I hunt. With a background in marketing and sales and a passion for strategic matchmaking, I operate more like a business developer than a traditional recruiter. I understand the power of timing, storytelling, and relationship-building, and I use all three to align top-tier professionals.
Whether itâ€™s scaling commercial teams, placing field leaders, or supporting executives, I move with urgency, lead with empathy, and stay focused on results. My work isnâ€™t just about filling jobs. Itâ€™s about driving revenue, elevating brands, and creating real impact when it matters most.

Apr 2021 - Mar 2022 Â· 1 yr

Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex Â· On-site

Trained under a licensed audiologist while supporting daily clinic operations and guiding patients through the evaluation and treatment process. I completed over 300 hours of training, including the 160 contact hours required by the state of Texasâ€”150 hours of supervised practicum and 10 hours dedicated to masking techniquesâ€”alongside classroom instruction and independent study.

This immersive program deepened my understanding of audiometric tools, patient counseling, and the technical craftsmanship behind hearing solutions. I assisted with evaluations, fittings, and device troubleshooting, working closely with patients to ensure clarity and comfort throughout their hearing care journey. My coursework also included psychology and counseling methods, equipping me to communicate with compassion and help patients process the emotional challenges of hearing loss.

I supported both front and back-office functions, contributed to product selection conversations, and helped educate patients on available options. This role balanced technical skill, service, and sales while reinforcing my belief that hearing care is not just a service, but a form of empowerment.â€¦ more

Over the course of 11 years with World Acceptance Corporation, I led one of the top-performing branches in the company.

As Branch Manager, I was responsible for all aspects of daily operations, team performance, and customer experience.

I managed a team of 3 and successfully trained 8 employees who were later promoted into leadership roles.

Through strong lending practices, effective collections, and a people-first leadership style, we more than doubled our growth targets and consistently exceeded profit goals by over 125%. Our branch ranked #1 in our division out of 427 stores and #3 companywide. These results were driven by strategy, execution, and trust.

During my tenure, I gained over a decade of experience in business and operational analysis. I regularly developed and presented performance reports to upper management, handled more than 4,000 customer service interactions monthly, and oversaw 800 or more tax returns each year.

August 4, 2025, Taylor was Jessicaâ€™s client

Jessica was an absolute standout during my recruitment process. As the National Recruiter at Blackmon Mooring & BMS CAT, she made the experience feel seamless, professional, and genuinely human.

From our first conversation, she was clear, supportive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the role and company. What really set her apart was her consistent communication. I never felt out of the loop or uncertain about next steps.

Jessicaâ€™s positive attitude, transparency, and dedication to finding the right fit made a lasting impression on me. Iâ€™m so grateful to have had her guidance during the process, and I would recommend her to any candidate or company looking for a recruiter who truly cares and delivers.

December 6, 2019, Benjamin worked with Jessica but they were at different companies

I have known Jessica for many years now. She has been my mentor in many ways, and an inspiration to myself and many others. Jessica is one of the friendliest, most likable people you will ever meet, and she is a pillar of strength in life's inevitable rough patches. I believe that Jessica can and will do anything that she sets her mind to effectively and efficiently, but more importantly I know the she possesses a natural charisma that cannot be taught. If you find yourself working alongside Jessica professionally, consider yourself fortunate.
