- `image`: Filename of the featured image (optional)
- `published`: Boolean indicating if the post is published
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the post was created
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp when the post was last modified

1. Create a public blog section on your website to display published posts
2. Add rich text editing capabilities (WYSIWYG editor)
3. Add categories or tags to blog posts
4. Implement blog post search functionality
5. Add comments system for blog posts

The foundation is now in place for a complete blog management system!
