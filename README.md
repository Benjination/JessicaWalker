### Blog Posts Not Loading on Public Site

**Solution**: Update Firestore security rules to allow public access to published posts:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (portfolio-7148b)
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database > Rules**
4. Replace existing rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /JessBlogs/{postId} {
      // Allow anyone to read published blog posts
      allow read: if resource.data.published == true;
      // Only authenticated users can write/read all posts
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"**

**See also**: `FIRESTORE_RULES.md` for detailed configuration instructions.
